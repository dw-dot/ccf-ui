    The Human Biomolecular Atlas Project (HuBMAP) will develop the next generation of molecular analysis technologies,
    computational tools, and to generate foundational tissue maps in order to accelerate the construction of an atlas of 
    the human body for the understanding the relationship between tissue organization and function.

  <h2>Common Coordinate Framework (CCF)</h2>
  <p>
    The HuBMAP common coordinate (reference) framework is under active development. 
    It aims to spatially annotate and index HuBMAP data so this data can be spatially located and explored efficiently. 
    The CCF v0.5.0 became available in March 2019. CCF Ontology documentation is available here and OWL file is available on GitHub.

  <h2>CCF User Interface (UI)</h2>
  <p>
    The CCF UI represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by multiple coordinate systems, including spatial, 
    physiologic, and organ-based browsing. This proof-of-concept user interface for the CCF v0.5.0 became available in June 2019 
    and will evolve as more data becomes available. CCF UI specification is available here and code is available on GitHub.
