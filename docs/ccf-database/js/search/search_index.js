This will be added in December with its scheduled refresh.\n\nRUI 1.0 BETA - 2020-10-16\nAdded in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nCreated the first version of the RUI 1.0. This version is a BETA and works in standalone mode only. The next version will include full support and integration into the HuBMAP Ingestion Portal.\n10 Reference Organs are available to choose from (a combination of 4 organs, 2 sexes, and one organ with 2 sides [kidney])\nImplemented automatic tagging of data via collisions with anatomical structures\nRUI Location data is in standard JSON-LD format linked via the CCF Ontology and related ontologies\nImplemented extraction sites display to help guide placement of tissues\n\nKnown Issues in RUI 1.0 BETA\n\nWhile support for embedding is implemented, more testing and collaboration with IEC is required before it is made fully available. Initial embedding documentation is available here.\nWhen adjusting transparency via the left-hand Anatomical Structures menu or Show Previous Registrations option, the transparency effect is not very good. This will be addressed before the RUI 1.0 production release.\nSometimes the 3d organ fails to load when clicking through reference organs quickly (and other side cases). If this happens, just refresh and try again.\n\n1.1.0 - 2020-07-31\nAdded in 1.1.0\n\nUpgraded to latest Vitessce Image Viewer and started showing processed TIFF images coming directly from the HuBMAP infrastructure\nProcessed CODEX and 10x datasets are shown in the HuBMAP Portal's visualization tool\nAdded a limited set of TIFF image thumbnails, with more to come\nAdded two qualitative color schemes for colorizing images in the image viewer\nBug fixes/performance optimizations\n\n1.0.0-rc.1 - 2020-06-22\n\n:warning: WARNING: This version is a release candidate.

This codifies the CCF data and metadata standards defined by MC-IU and will be used by the CCF EUI and RUI.\nIn preparation for future developments, we added a hidden, alpha-level 3d organ viewer. You can toggle this on and off in the organ view, by typing 3d with your keyboard.\nUpdated navigation to directly jump to the tissue browser when a user selects an item from the search box\nUpgraded dependencies, including upgrades to Angular 8\nTesting and bug fixes\nMinor UI updates\nChanged download icon color\nChanged the background color for the search\nMoved the Technologies filter above ontology\nAdditional styles for details button\n\n\n\n0.5.0 - 2019-05-24\nAdded in 0.5.0\n\nDisplay of the CCF ontology, integrated with search\nSemantic search by ontology, results are presented at all levels\nTissue overlays showing regions of interest\nData download links to direct users to https://sampledata.hubmapconsortium.org\nData documentation (95% coverage) and testing (85% coverage)\n\n0.2.0 - 2019-05-03\nAdded in 0.2.0\n\nSprint 2 release of the CCF-UI!\nA search interface was added to query data by age, sex, technology and TMC.
