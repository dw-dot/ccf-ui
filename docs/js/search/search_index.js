The CCF v1.0.0\n          became available in June 2020. The CCF Ontology is available as an OWL file,\n          on GitHub, and\n          on BioPortal.

The first\n          proof-of-concept user interface for the CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. The EUI continues to evolve\n          as more data becomes available.

It aims to semantically annotate and          spatially index HuBMAP data for efficient spatial and semantic search, browsing, and filtering. The CCF v1.0.0          became available in June 2020. The CCF Ontology is available as an OWL file,          on GitHub, and          on BioPortal. For          documentation, see CCF Portal and preprint of CCF          Ontology publication on arxiv.                CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI)                  The CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI) represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by          multiple coordinate systems, including spatial, physiologic, and organ-based browsing. The first          proof-of-concept user interface for the CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. The EUI continues to evolve          as more data becomes available. The CCF EUI code is available          on GitHub.          A demo video is on YouTube.

Interface (EUI).\n1.1.0 - 2020-07-31\nAdded in 1.1.0\n\nUpgraded to latest Vitessce Image Viewer and started showing processed TIFF images coming directly from the HuBMAP infrastructure\nProcessed CODEX and 10x datasets are shown in the HuBMAP Portal's visualization tool\nAdded a limited set of TIFF image thumbnails, with more to come\nAdded two qualitative color schemes for colorizing images in the image viewer\nBug fixes/performance optimizations\n\n1.0.0-rc.1 - 2020-06-22\n\n:warning: WARNING: This version is a release candidate. Some minor updates will likely happen between now and the official HuBMAP Data Release 1 in July.\n\nAdded in 1.0.0-rc.1\n\nBody UI interactions\nImage Viewer Integration\nPartonomy linkage to search / Body UI\nNow fully integrated into the HuBMAP Portal\n\nKnown Issues in 1.0.0-rc.1\n\nImage Viewer is using a placeholder .tiff until more .tiff images can be loaded from the IEC\n\n1.0.0-alpha.3 - 2019-05-08\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.3\n\nHooked up the interface to real data (not shown online as the data is not public yet)\nAdded the Tissue Browser on the right\nAdded the initial (Tissue) Image Viewer popup. Currently shows metadata, but no images yet.\nAdded an initial 3D Body. Tissues cuboids currently not displayed, but a test cuboid is shown.\nDocumentation (>90%) and testing coverage improved further\n\n1.0.0-alpha.2 - 2019-03-27\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.2\n\nIncreased documentation and testing coverage across the board\nAdded fullscreen button\nBug fixes and optimizations\n\n1.0.0-alpha.1 - 2019-03-06\nAdded in 1.0.0-alpha.1\n\nStarted the process of implementing the 1.0.0 UI spec\nSpec Doc\nUser Stories\n\n\nSetup the base project scaffolding for the new version\nAdded CCF Partonomy (CCF-P) search and tree display\nAdded a filter for filter tissues\n\n0.6.0 - 2019-11-08\nAdded in 0.6.0\n\nThe CCF API project was started with an initial OpenAPI Schema, documentation, and code for spinning up a mock data server. This codifies the CCF data and metadata standards defined by MC-IU and will be used by the CCF EUI and RUI.\nIn preparation for future developments, we added a hidden, alpha-level 3d organ viewer. You can toggle this on and off in the organ view, by typing 3d with your keyboard.\nUpdated navigation to directly jump to the tissue browser when a user selects an item from the search box\nUpgraded dependencies, including upgrades to Angular 8\nTesting and bug fixes\nMinor UI updates\nChanged download icon color\nChanged the background color for the search\nMoved the Technologies filter above ontology\nAdditional styles for details button\n\n\n\n0.5.0 - 2019-05-24\nAdded in 0.5.0\n\nDisplay of the CCF ontology, integrated with search\nSemantic search by ontology, results are presented at all levels\nTissue overlays showing regions of interest\nData download links to direct users to https://sampledata.hubmapconsortium.org\nData documentation (95% coverage) and testing (85% coverage)\n\n0.2.0 - 2019-05-03\nAdded in 0.2.0\n\nSprint 2 release of the CCF-UI!\nA search interface was added to query data by age, gender, technology and TMC. Ontological search will be implemented in the next sprint.\nBody, Organ, and Tissue views now respond to updates to the search on the fly\nAppropriate metadata is now displayed in the Body, Organ, Tissue, and Cell views\n\n0.1.0 - 2019-04-12\nAdded in 0.1.0\n\nSprint 1 release of the CCF-UI!\nSetup the base project scaffolding\nAdded a sample database that includes initial data provided by VU\nAdded Visual browsing of tissue samples and metadata at the whole body, organ, tissue, and cell level\nStay tuned!
